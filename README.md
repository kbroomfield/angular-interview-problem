# Angular Interview Problem
This project contains a *very* bad Angular component that needs to be rewritten. The acceptance critera are outlined in `app.component.ts` but will be added here as well.


+ Project should compile and work with no console errors.
+ Component should contain no syntactical mistakes.
+ Component should conform to current Angular standards.
+ Component should conform to current TypeScript and ES6 standards.
+ Component should correctly implement all functionality in the 'do-stuff' section.
+ It is NOT required to de-inline the component, thought it may be helpful.

## Pre-reqs
+ Node.JS
+ Angular CLI (`npm install -g @angular/cli` or `yarn global add @angular/cli`)

## To Get Started
+ Run the command `ng serve`
+ Open a browser to the designated URL, see what works, see what doesn't work, and then get to work!

**A Note**: It will probably be helpful to have an IDE that supports code highlighting on the inline HTML. Alternatively, you can split the template and styles into separate HTML and CSS files.
